# OCRLib
OCR and linguistic AI library

Dear friends! One year more our group has been developing OCR (optical character recognition) and translation system with Open Source code for Asian languages. So it is 10 years now:) wow!

At present it is OCR more then million pages for www.tbrc.org and www.dharmabook.ru libraries with support of Trace Foundation www.trace.org, St.Petersburg State University and Moscow Dharma Center Rime community members.

System ased on 5-level convolutional network, associative search in low-level database and grammar analysis.
In development dynamic classification and deep-lerning algorithms for hand write text recognition.

The key features of the OCR system include:

At present it is MacOS server version Tibetan, Sanskrit, Sinhala, Kannada, Latin and Cyrilic OCR.

High accuracy For Tibetan books, the current recognition results are 1-3 error per 1000 characters. It is include dictionary and mixed text. On next stages of development it is need same error level on manuscripts and damaged text OCR

Fast low-end database with associative search on base of Markov-chain algorithm 1gb/sec search with fuzzy query

Tibetan spell checker and dictionary on 359 000 words and 8.5 mln phrase list.

Poor resolution and damaged texts recognition. At present system OCR 72 dpi scanned texts. In development algorithm for hand write and xylographic text.

PHP and HTML based user interface. At present it is MacOS 10.8-10.9 Local version is Cocoa+PHP.

For OCR you can send us your texts for OCR www.dharmabook.ru/ocr/ - it is free as a WIND:)

ANY IDEA? = PLEASE MAIL US gomde (at) mail.ru we will help you to start use a program and source for your project. ALL SOURCE AND MACOS DMG(12Gb) www.dharmabook.ru/ocrlib
