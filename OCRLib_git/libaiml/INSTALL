libaiml installation
===================

1. Requirements
	You'll need three things to use libaiml:
	1) std_utils: a small static library that I use in all my projects with a lot of usefull stuff
	(it avoids repeting code). You can get it at my site: [1].
	2) libxml2: a XML parser (it came with my linux distro so you'll probably do fine), anyway
	you can find it at [2]
	3) An AIML set: I used the AAA set but you could use your own set obviously.
		WARNING: The AAA set wasn't the best choice for testing because it has some shadowed
		categories and can't be used all together. It is more like a starting point to do your own set.
		If you want to use the AAA set you should check the README file, there's some important
		info in there about it.
    
  4) Optionally, to enable JavaScript support in the interpreter you will need
  "SpiderMonkey" (the Mozilla JavaScript interpreter). [4]
		
2. Building:
	The plain ol' way: ./configure && make && make install
  NOTE: if you can't compile libaiml because there are warnings poping up, you
  can disable the 'treat warnings as errors' feature, using --disable-werror
  at configure time. YOU SHOULD STILL SEND ME A NOTICE ABOUT THE WARNING.
	
3. Testing
	A test_app will be built together with libaiml. You can use this to test you own AIML set
or get an idea of how libaiml works.

4. Using
	Read the README files regarding usage of the library. You actually need to do these things:
		*	use a properly configured .conf file
		* use properly written substitution and bot variables files
		* create a user dir with read/write permissions
		* find an AIML set to use with the interpreter
		* integrate the library to your project
		
	Check the core.h header as it contains the interface your program will be using. Once again
	read the README file for further instructions, this is just a brief intro to the library.
	
5. Notes
	At [3] you will find all my projects also.
	_DO_ read the README file. The ChangeLog may also hold important release information.
	Be sure to check these files.
