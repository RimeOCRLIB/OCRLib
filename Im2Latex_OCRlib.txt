Good day! Can you provide formula data you need OCR in frame of Im2Latex research request?
We have in development 10-years mature OCR c++ library with open code.
https://github.com/RimeOCRLIB/OCRLib
It is 5th level convolutional network algorithm with grammar rules and dictionary correction open source OCR engine.
We can build version for mathematical formula recognition you request in research request page. OCRLib might be used as base for applications in mathematical linguistic, visual recognition, mathematical analysis and modelling.
